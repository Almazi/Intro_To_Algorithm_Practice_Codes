# Insertion Sort
Take the "key" from the 2nd element of the array.

Compare it with all previous elements and put in the right place. If the key is smaller than any other previous element then the larger element will go right and eventually key will go to right.

The whole process takes place in the same array.
T.C: O(Nsq)
